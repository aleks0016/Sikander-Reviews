        <h2>Five Nights at Freddy's</h2>
        <p> October 27, 2023 - 15 - 1h, 49m <br><br>
          Horror, mystery, and thriller
          <br><br>
          A troubled security guard begins working at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza.
          During his first night on the job, he realizes that the night shift won't be so easy to get through.
          Pretty soon he will unveil what actually happened at Freddy's.
        </p>

        <p>Five Nights at Freddy's is a movie adaptation of the popular video game franchise.
          It stars Josh Hutcherson as Mike Schmidt, a security guard working at the abandoned Freddy Fazbear's Pizza
          restaurant.
          The film has been met with mixed reviews, with critics highlighting its strengths and weaknesses. <br><br>

          The film is praised for its attention to detail, particularly in the animatronics, which are described as
          faithful recreations of the video game series.
          However, the film's storytelling and pacing have been criticized.
          The plot is described as convoluted and shallow, and the pacing is said to be off. <br><br>

          The film is also criticized for not providing enough tension or horror to match the video game series it is
          based on.
          The film's attempt to expand the lore of the video game series is seen as overstuffed and confusing,
          failing to give audiences enough time to build a meaningful backstory. <br><br>

          Personally, I don't think the film was that incredibly exciting, but I've seen both much worse and better
          films,
          overall it's a pretty decent film, which I recommend to anyone who wants to go see it. <br><br></p>

        <h2>The Dictator</h2>
        <p> May 16, 2012 - 15 - 1h, 23m <br><br>
          Comedy
          <br><br>
          The heroic story of a dictator who risked his life to ensure that democracy would never come to the country he
          so lovingly oppressed.
        </p>
        <p>"The Dictator" is a comedy film starring Sacha Baron Cohen as General Aladeen, the tyrannical ruler of the
          oil-rich North African state Wadiya.
          The film has been described as a broad comedy satire that features big,
          conventionally contrived gags and a colossal central turn from Baron Cohen. <br><br>

          The film has been criticized for being less edgy than Baron Cohen's previous two films, "Borat" and "Bruno".
          It has been described as relentlessly immature and often offensive,
          reminiscent of the cheerfully reprehensible Kentucky Fried Movie in the 70s. <br><br>

          Despite the film's controversial nature, it has been praised for its humor.
          Some critics have noted that the film is not as hip as "Borat", but it does offer big goofy outrageous laughs.
          However, some critics have found the film to be wearing a little thin,
          despite the determination to throw as much as possible at the audience, in the aim of getting a laugh.
          <br><br>

          Personally, I think the movie was pretty good and funny. Very well made and it also has humor which makes it
          even better.
          This is a movie I recommend to everyone! <br><br>

        <h2>Krigsseileren</h2>
        <p> August 24, 2022 - 12 - 2h, 30m <br><br>War/Drama<br></p>
        <p>"Krigsseileren" or "War Sailor" is a Norwegian war drama movie directed by Gunnar Vikene,
          which premiered in the Norwegian International Film Festival in Haugesund and was later released theatrically
          in Norway on September 23, 2022.
          The film is based on true events and features a star-studded cast including Kristoffer Joner, Ine Marie
          Wilmann, and Henrikke Lund Olsen. <br><br>

          The film tells the story of Alfred (played by Kristoffer Joner) and Sigbjørn (played by Pål Sverre Hagen), two
          Norwegian sailors who joined the merchant marine during World War II.
          The film is set against the backdrop of the war and explores the challenges and experiences of the sailors.
          <br><br>

          The performances of the lead actors have been commended for their portrayal of the characters. Kristoffer
          Joner and Pål Sverre Hagen, in particular, have been praised for their roles. <br><br>

          "War Sailor" provides a compelling depiction of the experiences of the Norwegian merchant navy during World
          War II.
          It offers a profound exploration of the psychological impact of war, making it a phenomenal work of art.
          <br><br>

          As a fan of history and war movies, I thought the movie was quite good and exciting.
          Despite its length, the film is a must-see for those interested in historical dramas and war films.<br><br>

        <h2>Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes</h2>
        <p>November 17, 2023 - 12A - 2h, 38m <br><br>Action / Adventure / Drama<br></p>
        <p>"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes" is a prequel to the beloved franchise,
          and it successfully captures the essence of the original series while introducing new characters and
          plotlines.
          The film is a thrilling, action-packed experience that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats from start to
          finish. <br><br>

          The film's action sequences are particularly impressive.
          The Hunger Games are depicted as a far cry from the high-tech spectacle in the original series,
          and the humble beginnings add to the excitement of the film.
          The arena action is handled with the required energy, and the battles are terrifying. <br><br>

          The performances of the lead actors, particularly Rachel Zegler, are commendable.
          Zegler brings a unique charm to her character, Lucy Gray, and her folksy charm is used effectively throughout
          the film.
          Tom Blyth's portrayal of Coriolanus Snow is also noteworthy, delivering a complex and nuanced performance.
          <br><br>

          However, the film does have some shortcomings.
          The runtime is long, and the film occasionally struggles with pacing, especially within the third act.
          Some reviewers felt that the film's story was a bit overstuffed and didn't add much to the overall narrative.
          <br><br>

          Despite these minor issues,
          "The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes" is a satisfying prequel that successfully captures the
          essence of the original series.
          It offers a fresh perspective on the world of Panem, and the performances of the lead actors add depth to
          their characters.
          The film is a must-watch for fans of the original series and a promising addition to the franchise.<br><br>

        <h2>There's Something in the Barn</h2>
        <p>November 10, 2023 - 15 - 1h, 40m <br><br>Comedy / Fantasy / Horror / Christmas<br></p>
        <p>After inheriting a farm in Gudbrandsdalen, an American family moves to Norway to get closer to their roots,
          and a lifelong dream comes true.
          But soon mysterious things begin to happen, because they are not the only ones living on the farm. <br><br>

          "There's Something in the Barn" is a delightful blend of comedy and horror that manages to captivate its
          audience from start to finish.
          The film is set in Norway and revolves around an American family who moves into a remote cabin after
          inheriting it.
          They plan to turn the adjoining barn into a bed and breakfast,
          but they end up disturbing an ancient Barn Elf who will go to deadly lengths to drive the family away.
          <br><br>

          The film's humor is both absurd and delightful.
          The elves, in particular, are a source of hilarity, with their antics and the ridiculous errors they make,
          such as one of them accidentally shooting their friend, then turning the gun to have a proper look at it and
          shooting themselves too.
          The film also has a playful take on Nordic mythology, which adds to its charm. <br><br>

          The film's horror elements are not as strong as its comedy, but they add a layer of suspense and excitement.
          There are a few gory scenes that are well-executed and contribute to the overall atmosphere of the film.
          <br><br>

          In conclusion, "There's Something in the Barn" is a fun and entertaining film that combines elements of comedy
          and horror in a unique and enjoyable way.

        <h2>Johnny English</h2>
        <p> April 11, 2003 - PG - 1h, 28m <br><br>
          Action / Comedy
          <br>
        </p>
        <p>The Johnny English series, starring Rowan Atkinson, is a trio of comedy films that center around the
          character Johnny English, a British agent.
          The first film, "Johnny English",
          introduces us to Johnny English as an incompetent MI7 office worker who is promoted to top agent and tasked to
          investigate the theft of the Crown Jewels <br><br>


          "Johnny English Reborn", the second film, sees Johnny English brought back to the MI7 to investigate a group
          of assassins known as Vortex.
          The third and most recent film, "Johnny English Strikes Again", is set 15 years after the first movie and
          seven years after the sequel.
          In this film, Johnny English has retired and is teaching at a boarding school in the British countryside.
          However, he is called back into service because a cyber-attack has exposed every agent in the field <br><br>

          The Johnny English series is known for its slapstick humor and physical comedy. Atkinson's performance is
          praised for his ability to deliver these elements effectively.

          humor and slapstick for its humor.

          its inability to adapt to the modern age. <br><br>
